_\*\*Only required for swaylock_

Run these commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR=/etc ..
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /usr/local/bin/sway

On systems without logind, you need to suid the sway binary:

    sudo chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/sway

## Configuration

If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to `~/.config/sway/config` and
it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy the sample configuration file to
`~/.config/sway/config`. It is usually located at `/etc/sway/config`.
Run `man 5 sway` for information on the configuration.

My own dotfiles are available [here](https://gogs.sr.ht/SirCmpwn/dotfiles) if
you want some inspiration, and definitely check out the
[wiki](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/wiki) as well.

## Running

Instead of running `startx`, run `sway`. You can run `sway` from within X as
well, which is useful for testing.
